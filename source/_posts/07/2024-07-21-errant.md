We had the ceramic artist Carme Malaret working in our garden for the weekend.

The idea was social media and how we are all superficially connected but not really. There are little people trapped inside each tube.

In the high part of the town there was this wooden deer sculpture.

Outside the church there was another wooden sculpture representing the rights to food and shelter.

At its high point it represents the right to be able to see the sky.

Another artist worked in carving out logs for holding water.

And this mural is perhaps the only permanent artwork from the festival.
