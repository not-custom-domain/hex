We went hiking with Pol and Gina and Donnacha to the refuge J.M. Blanc in the Aigüestortes National Park.

It's probably the best-appointed hostel in the mountains. That's it there at the edge of the lake. Beautiful photograph from Rebecca.

We walked there, and it was a long way. Even Saoirse walked some of the way, but not much.

On the way down, it rained for a little while, so Riu put on her poncho.
